1. You need to enter to the file MySecondProgram.java.
2. Click on the pencil (edit this file) in the right upper corner of your file to start working!
3. You can copy the code to you VS Code and work from there (recommended) or you can directly work from GitHub.
4. When you're done, you paste the code in your MySecondProgram.java and click on commit changes and that's it!

For this activity, you can check what you need to do in the following link https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eCUfjZ_w5CGry1myN7YnOrqM4SbwNX_YQ0Lk1gC_Yes/edit#slide=id.g22cde15c208_0_6

For the Variable Manipulation activity, you need to:

(1) Define two String variables and provide any value that you want.
(2) Define two numbers (one of them must be a decimal number).
(3) Define a variable called third that will hold the third character from the first String defined in (1).
(4) Define a variable called sum that will store the addition of the two numbers that you defined in (2).
(5) Define a variable called second that will contain the value of second String from (1). The content of the second character must be in uppercase.
(6) Define a String variable called password that will be composed of the following characters:

After compiling and running your program, this is the expected output (exactly like this):
1st String: Computer
2nd String: Science
1st Number: 5
2nd Number: 3.5
Third Character from Computer: m
Sum: 8.5
Second: SCience
Password: Sc5r3.5/
```
